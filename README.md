# Punderful

Punderful is a #BuildInPublic project that collects puns from anyone and helps them find ones that make them chuckle.

It is built with ðŸ§¡ on the [Cloudflare Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH5-m0aiO5g). Most importantly, this code focusses heavily on the new kid on the block [Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows).

## Setup

You should be able to create all of this on the free tier. Let me know if you run into any problems

### D1

This uses a D1 database, so you need to create one

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create punderful
```

Copy and Paste the returned value and replace it in [wrangler.toml](./wrangler.toml)

*Dev mode*

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply punderful
```

*Production*

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply punderful --remote
```

### Vectorize

Create the index with the settings of the embedding model we are going to use

```bash
npx wrangler@beta vectorize create punderful --preset "@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5"
```

(This is already in wrangler.toml)

### KV

Create the namespace

```bash
npx wrangler@workflows kv namespace create LEADERBOARD
```

Copy and Paste the returned value into [wrangler.toml](./wrangler.toml)

### Optional: OpenAI

Moderation is available using the free OpenAI the PublishWorkflow. You will need an OpenAI API Key to use it.

```bash
npx wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY 
```

## Develop

You can develop locally, mostly.

```bash
npm run dev
```

But you should really deploy it (probably).

```bash
npm run deploy
```
